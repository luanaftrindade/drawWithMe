Draw with Me @ Map Editor - An application where you can draw in multiple colors, erase, and save your creations. 
This project was born during my sixth week at the Code for All bootcamp, focusing on full-stack development. It's a creation entirely developed in Java, with Simple GFX as the primary graphical library.
